# DataScience-Portfolio
A collection of my data science projects, analyses, and experiments
Hi, I’m Sepideh Zarei.  
This is a small space where I share my practice and beginner data science projects, step by step.  

Topics I’m most interested in:  
- Financial and banking data analysis  
- Nature and environmental datasets  
- Learning and practicing with Python, Pandas, and Excel  

These projects may start simple, but my goal is to improve them over time and show my learning journey.
